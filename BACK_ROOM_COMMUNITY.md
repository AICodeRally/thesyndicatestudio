# The Back Room — Community Platform Specification

## Overview

**The Back Room** is where serious SPM professionals discuss implementation, share questions, and reference Counsel.

It's not a generic forum. It's a framework-aligned, Counsel-linked community where every discussion gets routed through your SPM taxonomy.

**Platform:** Substack (recommended)
**Tone:** Professional salon, not hype. No vendors. No pitches. Just truth.
**Signal-to-noise ratio:** Managed through channel structure + moderation rules.

---

## Philosophy

The Back Room exists to:
1. **Surface questions** that become Todd Takes
2. **Validate Counsel** (real professionals testing ideas)
3. **Build trust** (transparent, evidence-based discussions)
4. **Route discussions** (framework-aligned channels prevent chaos)

It's NOT:
- A general chat forum
- A vendor showcase
- A place for complaints (they belong in #disputes)
- A sales funnel for SPARCC (let it happen naturally)

---

## Channel Structure (Framework-Aligned)

## Posting Rules (High-Signal)

**Every post must:**

### 1. Reference a Counsel or Topic
```
Good:
"Question about [Counsel: Quota Setting Strategy]...
We're adjusting Q4 quotas using the credibility method described here.
Question: Should we adjust for new hires?"

Bad:
"How do we set quotas?"
(Vague, no context, no framework)
```

### 2. Show Your Work (Not Vibes)
```
Good:
"We set quotas at 85th percentile of last year's results.
Reps are at 67% attainment right now (mid-quarter).
Is this method fair if market conditions changed?"

Bad:
"I think quotas are unfair. HELP."
(No data, no specifics)
```

### 3. Link to Counsel (If Applicable)
```
Post: "Question about quota relief..."
Sidebar recommendation: "Relevant Counsel: [Quota Relief Protocol]"
(System auto-suggests when poster mentions keywords)
```

### 4. No Vendor Spam
```
Bad:
"We switched to [Vendor]. Their system is amazing!!!"

Bad:
"Has anyone implemented [Vendor]? How does it work with draws?"

Acceptable:
"We use [Vendor]. Their draw payback logic doesn't support our usecase.
Has anyone solved this?"
(Specific problem, not pitch)
```

### 5. No Complaints Without Context
```
Bad:
"My comp plan is broken. Nobody listens to me."
(Vent, not discussion)

Good:
"Our comp plan creates a fairness problem in [specific scenario].
Counsel: [Disputes Protocol] doesn't cover this. What do others do?"
(Specific problem, looking for evidence)
```

## Moderation Rules

### Auto-enforcement (System Rules)
- Posts must include a channel tag (enforced on submission)
- Standalone vendor names are flagged (must add context)
- No external links except to Counsel, videos, or Substack

### Manual Moderation (You + Trusted Mods)

**Remove:**
- Vendor pitches (off-topic)
- "Buy my course" posts
- Personal attacks
- Irrelevant threads

**Lock:**
- Threads devolving into complaints without data
- Vendor flame wars

**Redirect:**
- "This seems like a DISPUTES question" → Move to #disputes
- "You might be looking for this Counsel → [Link]"
- "This is a great Todd Take idea. I'll put it on the list."

**Encourage:**
- Pin good Q&A (real problem + real answer)
- Call out threads with shared learnings ("Lots of people asked this")
- Thank people who cite Counsel (positive reinforcement)

## Moderation Template (Responding to Rule Violations)

### Gentle Redirect
```
"Good question! This sounds like a #DISPUTES issue.
Try posting in that channel — you'll find people with experience there.

Also, here's a related Counsel: [Link]"
```

### Enforcement
```
"We keep The Back Room focused on SPM implementation questions.
Your post was removed because it reads like vendor marketing.

If you want to discuss implementation challenges with [Vendor], that's welcome!
Please reframe: 'We use [Vendor] and hit this problem...' and post to the relevant channel."
```

### Encouragement
```
"This is exactly the kind of specific, data-backed question we need.
Great context. Have you checked [Counsel]? It might have a shortcut."
```

## The Back Room as Trust Machine

Why this works:

1. **Signal-to-noise is protected.** Channels + rules = no spam.
2. **Counsel is canonical.** Every discussion references back to tested artifacts.
3. **You learn faster.** 100 professionals sharing problems = you see patterns competitors miss.
4. **It becomes defensible.** "5 people hit this, here's how we solved it" is better than "I think..."
5. **It feeds content.** Every month, you have 20+ Todd Take ideas from real questions.

This is not a community feature. It's a knowledge machine.
