**Anatomy:**
- Cold open (provocative question or statement)

- Takeaway (one-liner)
- Close (no sales pitch)

**Deliverables:**
- 1 mp4 file
- Transcript (auto-generated, you edit)

**Publication:**

- LinkedIn (short clip + text)
- Shorts (3× 30-45s clips)
- Newsletter (text + video link)

---

## 2. SPARCC: Counsel Generation

When Todd Take goes live, SPARCC processes it:

### 2a. Ingestion
```
Input: Todd Take transcript
Process:
  - Identify actionable insights
  - Extract key mechanisms/frameworks
  - Categorize by SPM domain
  - Suggest Counsel type + channel
Output: 3-7 proposed Counsel items
```

### 2b. Counsel Generation Templates (Examples)

**From Todd Take: "Why Accelerators Break Forecasting"**

```
Generated:

1. FIELD NOTE
   Title: "Why Accelerators Break Forecasting"
   Channel: PAYOUT_CURVES
   Tags: [accelerators, forecasting, behavior]
   Difficulty: OPERATOR

2. CHECKLIST
   Title: "Accelerator Risk Assessment"
   Channel: PAYOUT_CURVES
   Tags: [accelerators, risk, planning]
   Difficulty: OPERATOR

3. DIAGNOSTIC
   Title: "How Accelerators Distort Deal Timing"
   Channel: PAYOUT_CURVES
   Tags: [accelerators, behavior, cliff-effects]
   Difficulty: MANAGER

4. TEMPLATE
   Title: "Safe Accelerator Structure (Template)"
   Channel: PAYOUT_CURVES
   Tags: [accelerators, design, safety]
   Difficulty: ARCHITECT
   Subtype: Ledger-backed
```

### 2c. You Approve & Edit

**Workflow:**
1. SPARCC shows 3-7 proposed Counsel
2. You review (2-5 min per batch)
3. You edit titles, clarify content, adjust type/channel if needed
4. You hit "Publish"
5. Counsel go live alongside the video

**What you might change:**
- Title clarity (make it more actionable)
- Channel reassignment (if SPARCC got it wrong)
- Merge two weak items into one strong one
- Split one item into two
- Reject something that's not sharp enough

**Rule:** At least 3 Counsel per Todd Take. Up to 7 if the topic is meaty.

## 4. Vault: Collection & Customization

**Trigger:** Viewer watches video → Clicks "Collect this Counsel" or "Create Vault" CTA

**Journey:**

### 4a. First Time: Create Vault
```
"Create a free Family Vault to collect Counsel."
  → Email + password signup
  → (Optional) Role selection
  → Success: "Your Vault is ready. Save [Counsel Title] to get started."
  → Auto-save first Counsel viewer just watched
```

### 4b. Recurring: Save Counsel
```
Viewer watching Todd Take → Sees "Collect this Counsel" buttons
  → Clicks button next to Counsel they care about
  → If not logged in: Quick signup → Save
  → If logged in: Choose collection → Save
  → Notification: "Saved to [Collection Name]"
```

### 4c. Customization: Add Context
```
In Vault → Open saved Counsel
  → Click "Add your notes"
  → Write: "Applied this to Q4 planning. Adjusted timeline for..."
  → Counsel now shows:
    - Original Counsel
    - Your notes (highlighted)
  → Can export with or without notes
```

### 4d. Share with Team
```
In Vault → Select 3-5 related Counsel
  → "Create a collection" (name it "Q4 Plan Design Review")
  → "Share this collection"
  → Generate link → Email to team/legal/finance
  → They view read-only version (no account needed)
```

**Key Insight:** Counsel in the Vault become decision artifacts. The notes are evidence.

## 5. Community: The Back Room (Substack)

**Purpose:** Surface questions → Mine for next month's Ask Todd Live

**Structure:**

### Channels (Framework-aligned)
```
PLAN_DESIGN
MEASURES_CREDITING
PAYOUT_CURVES
QUOTA_TERRITORY
DRAWS_SPIFFS
GOVERNANCE
DISPUTES_APPEALS
ICM_OPS
AI_FOR_SPM
```

### Posting Rules (High-signal)
```
1. Every post links to a related Counsel
   (else: "What Counsel should apply here?")

2. Share your context (Counsel reference)
   "We're using [Counsel Name]. Question: ..."

3. Show your work (not vibes)
   "We set quota at [method]. Reps hitting [attainment]."

4. No vendor spam
   (This is professionals talking to professionals)
```

### Workflows

**User Post:**
1. Browse The Back Room channels
2. Find related Counsel (sidebar recommendation)
3. Post: "Question about [Counsel]..."
4. You or mods respond with:
   - Direct answer
   - Next Counsel to review
   - "Suggest a Todd Take topic?" link

**You Mine Questions:**
1. Scan community threads weekly
2. Note recurring themes
3. "This question came up 5 times this week → Todd Take idea"
4. Use actual questions for Ask Todd Live topics

**Example Loop:**
```
Week 1:
  - 5 people ask about fairness in quota relief

Week 2:
  - You recognize pattern
  - Add "Quota Relief Fairness" to Ask Todd Live topics

Month 2:
  - Ask Todd Live session on quota relief
  - Generate new Counsel: "Fairness Checklist"
  - Community discusses with evidence
```

---

## 6. Ask Todd Live: Monthly Q&A

**Sourced From:**
- Community questions (The Back Room threads)
- Viewer comments on YouTube
- Submitted questions (form on site)
- Email inbox

**Preparation (1 week before):**
1. Scan community for 5-10 recurring themes
2. Pick 1 for opening thesis
3. Pre-plan 3-4 topics (but keep live questions open)
4. Brief talking points (bullets only, no script)

**Session Structure:**
```
1. Opening Thesis (5 min)
   "This month: Why quota relief failures are usually design failures"

2. Live Q&A (30–40 min)
   - Unfiltered questions from live audience
   - You answer directly + show your reasoning
   - Reference relevant Counsel as you go

3. Todd's Line (5 min)
   One blunt conclusion:
   "If you can't explain why someone didn't get quota relief, your system isn't designed."

4. Hard stop
   No rambling. Authority respects time.
```

**Archiving & Clipping:**
```
Post-session (same day):
  1. Publish full video to YouTube
  2. Extract 5 clips (30–45 sec each)
  3. Generate Counsel from Q&A insights (2-4 new items)
  4. Create Substack post: Session notes + clips + Counsel
  5. Schedule clips to LinkedIn/TikTok over following week
```

---

## 7. Feedback Loop (Close the Machine)

**Questions → Counsel → Videos → Community → Questions**

```
Month 1 (Oct):
  Ask Todd Live Session #1
    → 3 recurring Q&A patterns emerge
    → 2 new Counsel generated
    → Community discusses with new Counsel

Month 2 (Nov):
  You notice: "Quota Relief Fairness" is #1 question
    → Plan Todd Takes on this topic
    → Script 2 videos specifically to address

Month 3 (Dec):
  Publish "Quota Relief Fairness" Todd Takes (2-3 videos)
    → Generate 6-9 new Counsel variants
    → Community gathers around new resources
    → Ask Todd Live #2: Exclusively on quota relief

Month 4 (Jan):
  By now: 20+ pieces of content on quota relief
    → Vault users have collected 12-15 Counsel on this
    → Community created shared language
    → New professionals see: "Oh, there's a whole system for this"
```

## 8. Conversion Funnels (Where Money Comes From)

### Funnel 1: Vault → Services
```
User collects 5+ Counsel
  → Spends 2+ hours in Vault
  → Tries "Ask The Toddfather" 3+ times
  → Vault shows: "Need help implementing? Request SPM Help"
  → Clicks → Services intake form
  → Sales conversation
```

**Why this works:**
- They've invested time (sunk cost)
- They understand the framework (you've educated them)
- They see the gap (Vault → Ask → "I need a human")
- They're pre-qualified (they care about SPM)

### Funnel 2: Community → Ask Todd Live → SPARCC
```
Lurk in The Back Room
  → See deep expertise on display
  → Attend Ask Todd Live
  → Experience unfiltered Q&A
  → "Can I get this kind of help on demand?"
  → Upgrade to SPARCC subscription (Ask The Toddfather chat)
```

**Why this works:**
- Community is free (lowers barrier)
- Live session is live (proves expertise)
- Subscription is a small ask ($X/mo)
- They already use Ask in the Vault (upgrade path is clear)

### Funnel 3: Content → Services
```
Watch Todd Take #1 (YouTube)
  → Resonates
  → Watch Todd Take #2, #3
  → "I need someone to help me fix this"
  → Find: "Request SPM Help" CTA
  → Services intake
```

**Why this works:**
- Free content removes objection to "am I the right person?"
- Repetition (3+ videos) increases credibility
- CTA is obvious (not hidden)
- They've self-qualified (watched multiple = serious)

## 11. The Moat

Why this works better than competitors:

1. **Content isn't noise.** Every piece of content generates a reusable Counsel asset.

2. **Counsel is earned, not generic.** Each Counsel comes from real questions, real problems, real video context.

3. **Vault creates switching costs.** Users have invested time collecting, customizing, organizing. They won't start over.

4. **Community surfaces truth.** Real questions from real practitioners keep you honest.

5. **Loop is self-feeding.** Community questions → Todd Takes → Counsel → Community impact.

6. **You're building IP.** Every month, you own more Counsel assets. They're harder to copy.

This is why the system survives competitors: they're playing content. You're building a knowledge infrastructure.
