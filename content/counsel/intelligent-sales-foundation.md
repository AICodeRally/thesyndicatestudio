## Problem Statement

Most sales organizations run on contradictions: strategy says one thing, planning assumes another, enablement trains a third, and compensation rewards something completely different. Reps optimize their paychecks—not because they're mercenary, but because it's the only clear signal in a noisy system.

When these four systems don't align, you get predictable failure modes:
- Strategy says "sell the platform," comp says "any deal counts"
- Planning assumes 100% quota attainment, comp curves spike at 80%
- Enablement teaches consultative selling, comp rewards fast closes
- Leadership blames "execution issues" when the system design guaranteed the behavior

## Mechanism (Why This Happens)

Sales compensation is the most powerful behavior signal in your org. It's:
- **More frequent** than performance reviews (monthly vs. annual)
- **More tangible** than strategic goals (cash vs. vision)
- **More immediate** than career growth (this quarter vs. someday)

Reps solve a daily optimization problem: "What action maximizes my payout with the least risk?" If that answer doesn't align with company strategy, the company loses—every time.

Misalignment happens because these systems are owned by different people:
- **Strategy**: Executive team
- **Planning**: Sales ops + finance
- **Enablement**: Sales enablement + marketing
- **Compensation**: HR + comp committee

Each optimizes locally. Nobody owns the integrated behavior outcome.

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Map Current Contradictions (15 min)
List your top 3 strategic priorities. For each, ask:
- What does planning assume about this priority?
- What does enablement teach about executing it?
- What does comp reward when reps do it?
- What's the contradiction?

Example:
- **Strategy**: "Sell to enterprise accounts"
- **Planning**: Territory model treats all accounts as equal revenue potential
- **Enablement**: Trains on enterprise sales cycles (6+ months)
- **Comp**: Pays monthly, rewarding any closed deal equally
- **Contradiction**: Reps avoid enterprise (long cycles, same commission)

### 2. Start with Compensation (Next planning cycle)
Don't change strategy to match comp. Change comp to encode strategy.

Ask: "If we paid exactly what we say we want, what would the plan look like?"

Test it:
- Would a rep following this plan execute our strategy?
- Would they make more money doing what we want than gaming the system?
- Can we explain the plan's logic in under 60 seconds?

### 3. Build Traceability (Ongoing)
Every comp plan component should trace back to a strategic choice:
- Quota → Capacity model → Revenue target → Strategic plan
- Accelerator → Behavior we want more of → Strategic priority
- Threshold → Minimum acceptable performance → Quality gate

If you can't draw the line, cut the component.

## Common Pitfalls

**"We'll fix it with training"**
Enablement can't override economic incentives. If your plan rewards bad behavior, training will fail.

**"Reps should just do the right thing"**
They are doing the right thing—for their paychecks. Design a plan that makes "right for the company" = "right for the rep."

**"We need to keep it simple"**
Simple doesn't mean "avoid complexity." It means "clear cause and effect." A plan can have 10 components and still be simple if reps can predict their payouts.

**"This year's plan is special"**
Every comp plan is a behavior experiment. If you can't articulate the hypothesis ("We believe accelerators at X% will drive Y behavior"), you're not designing—you're guessing.

## Assumptions

- Reps are rational economic actors (they optimize payout given constraints)
- Compensation is the strongest short-term behavior signal
- Misalignment is a system design problem, not a people problem
- Strategy should drive comp design, not the reverse
